To use this module, you need to:

1.  Go to *Sales \> Orders \> quotations* and create a new one.
2.  Add a sale order line with a storable product
3.  Click on the icon
    ![fa_info_circle](../static/src/img/info-circle-solid.png) in the
    line and you will see in the popover the 'Available to promise'
    quantity of the corresponding product.

Note: Now the color of the icon depends on the 'Available to promise'
quantity of the corresponding product instead of 'Forecast Quantity'. If
that quantity is less than the quantity to deliver, the color of the
icon will be red, indicating an alert; otherwise it will be blue.
